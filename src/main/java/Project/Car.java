/*Create a Class Car that would have the following fields: carPrice and
        color and method calculateSalePrice() which should be returning a
        price of the car.
        Create 2 sub classes: Sedan and Truck. The Truck class has a field
        as weight and has its own implementation of calculateSalePrice()
        method in which returned price is calculated as following: if
        weight>2000 then returned price car should include 10% discount,
        otherwise 20% discount.
        The Sedan class has field as length and also does it is own
        implementation of calculateSalePrice(): if length of sedan is >20 feet
        then returned car price should include 5% discount, otherwise 10%

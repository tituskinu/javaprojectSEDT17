nested loops:
    Nested is a loop inside another loop. nested loops are used to solve complex problems in which we have nested data or we need
    to opertate in a nested ilitarations. we can nest a for loop
why nested loop:
    tester will be needing them to read excell data
    we will needed threm to read to go through multiple pages and form
    each page we might need to go through multiple time

Syntax:
    for(i=0;i<10;i++){
        for(j=0;j<10;i++{
        }
    }

Array:
    array help as store multiple objects of the same type in just one variable
    they are indect base datastructures. every item that we store inside an array
    is assighned a number is called index. whenever we need to get any value from array we provide the index

WHy we should use array:
    we can use multiple variables as well to store multiple items but variables data is larger it almost imposible
    to handle the variable. imargine we are store thename of all the persons livimg in a city.

Syntax:
    There are two ways of creating an array.
    1)Datatype [] nameOfArray={element1,element2,element3}
    int [] ages ={20,30,45,22,85,74}

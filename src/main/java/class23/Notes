Encapsulation:
    Create classes to write code and store data. use private access modifiers
    to secure the data by limiting the access. Create getter setter method
    for every filed if you want others to change or see those fields.
Why should we learn about Encapsulation?
    it improve the control over the data that we store in the filed of the class
    which leads us to more secure code.
Collection framework:
    collection frame work in java contain a lot of classes, methods and interfaces.
     which helps as store and manipulate large amount of data easily and effectively which are all dynamic(in changing size of an ArrayList)
Why collection framework
    Arrays have limitations
    1)They are fix in size meaning once we provide the size we can't change it afterword.
    2)They don't have any built-in methods to help process the data.

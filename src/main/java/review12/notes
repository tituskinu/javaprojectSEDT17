Set:
    Sets are special set of classes which don't allow duplicate elements.
    Set is the main interface and their are three main classes which implement this
    interface. 1)Hashset
                2)LinkedHashSet
                3) TreeSet
HashSet:
        UpSide:its fastest of all.
        DownSide: its does not remember the insertion order.
LinkedHashSet:
        Upside: Maintains the insertion order.
        DownSide: its a little slower than HashSet.
TreeSet:
        Upside: Keep the data in sorted Form.
        DownSide: Insertion is very very slow.
Maps:
        Map is an interface that allows us to store key value pairs.
